LMDB
====

This is a fork of Lightning MDB, a Berkeley DB replacement developed for the OpenLDAP project. LMDB has its own repository [on gitorious](https://gitorious.org/mdb/mdb/source/9cc04f604f80f033d712f5f1faeb4ed97ca74f40:). But it doesn't accept pull requests.

I'll be aiming to get any modifications here into the official LMDB release through the normal OpenLDAP ITS. But, mostly, this repository exists as a backup of LMDB, because I feel more comfortable to have my own copy of this open source software upon which my project may depend.
